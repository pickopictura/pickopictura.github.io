	<h2> section element </h2>
	==================<br>
	"A section is a thematic grouping of content, typically with a heading."
	
	 <section>
  <h1>WWF</h1>
  <p>The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) is....</p>
	</section> 
	
	<h2>article</h2>
	==================<br>
	The <article> element specifies independent, self-contained content.

An article should make sense on its own, and it should be possible to read it independently from the rest of the web site.

Examples of where an < article > element can be used:

    Forum post
    Blog post
    Newspaper article

 <article>
  <h1>What Does WWF Do?</h1>
  <p>WWF's mission is to stop the degradation of our planet's natural environment,
  and build a future in which humans live in harmony with nature.</p>
</article> 

Nesting Semantic Elements

On the Internet, you will find HTML pages with <section> elements containing <article> elements, and <article> elements containing <sections> elements.

You will also find pages with <section> elements containing <section> elements, and <article> elements containing <article> elements.

Note 	Newspaper: The sports articles in the sports section, have a technical section in each article.

<h2>header</h2>
	==================<br>
	The <header> element specifies a header for a document or section.

The <header> element should be used as a container for introductory content.

You can have several <header> elements in one document.

 <article>
  <header>
    <h1>What Does WWF Do?</h1>
    <p>WWF's mission:</p>
  </header>
  <p>WWF's mission is to stop the degradation of our planet's natural environment,
  and build a future in which humans live in harmony with nature.</p>
</article> 


<h2>Footer</h2>
	==================<br>
The <footer> element specifies a footer for a document or section.

A <footer> element should contain information about its containing element.

A footer typically contains the author of the document, copyright information, links to terms of use, contact information, etc.

You can have several <footer> elements in one document.

 <footer>
  <p>Posted by: Hege Refsnes</p>
  <p>Contact information: <a href="mailto:someone@example.com">
  someone@example.com</a>.</p>
</footer> 


<h2>Navigation</h2>
	==================<br>
The <nav> element defines a set of navigation links.

The <nav> element is intended for large blocks of navigation links. However, not all links in a document should be inside a <nav> element! 

 <nav>
  <a href="/html/">HTML</a> |
  <a href="/css/">CSS</a> |
  <a href="/js/">JavaScript</a> |
  <a href="/jquery/">jQuery</a>
</nav> 


<h2>Aside</h2>
	==================<br>
The <aside> element defines some content aside from the content it is placed in (like a sidebar).

The aside content should be related to the surrounding content.

 <p>My family and I visited The Epcot center this summer.</p>

<aside>
  <h4>Epcot Center</h4>
  <p>The Epcot Center is a theme park in Disney World, Florida.</p>
</aside> 

<h2> < figure > and < figcaption ></h2>
	==================<br>
	In books and newspapers, it is common to have captions with images.

The purpose of a caption is to add a visual explanation to an image.

With HTML5, images and captions can be grouped together in <figure> elements:

 <figure>
  <img src="img/mountain.jpg" alt="The Mountain Somewhere" >
  <figcaption>Fig1. - The Pulpit Rock, Norway.</figcaption>
</figure>
